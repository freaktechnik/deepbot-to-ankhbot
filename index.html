        <h1>DeepBot2AnkhBot Migration Helper</h1>
        <p>This site outputs users and points in a format that can be imported to AnkhBot. Make sure DeepBot is running while using this tool. Enter your DeepBot's API key before pressing <samp>Generate</samp>. After that the site will load all users from DeepBot (the more users, the longer it takes) and finally output a list, which you can then copy and import into AnkhBot.</p>
